# Yet Another Shopify PHP API (yaspa)

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/paulchiu/yaspa/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/paulchiu/yaspa/tree/master)

## Installation

*Do not install this library. It is currently under active development
and is in no way stable.*

## Purpose

Most Shopify APIs appear to be thin wrappers around Guzzle that makes things
slightly more convenient but still makes it feel like you are interacting with a
REST API.

The goal of this project is to go one step beyond and provide something closer
to a SDK whereby the library offers everything through PHP without the developer
needing to think too much about the REST API.

## Examples

The following examples show how CRUD works with the API. For full documentation,
see the [Yaspa Gitbook][docs].

Please note that all examples utilise private authentication.

### Create private authentication credentials

Credentials are stored in a POPO (Plain Old PHP Object) model.

All other examples assume the presence of the following code.

```php
use Yaspa\Authentication\Factory\ApiCredentials;
use Yaspa\Factory;

$credentials = Factory::make(ApiCredentials::class)
    ->makePrivate(
        'my-shop',
        '4ac0000000000000000000000000035f',
        '59c0000000000000000000000000007f'
    );
```

### Create a customer

```php
use Yaspa\AdminApi\Customer\Builders\CreateNewCustomerRequest;
use Yaspa\AdminApi\Customer\CustomerService;
use Yaspa\AdminApi\Customer\Models\Customer;
use Yaspa\Factory;

// Prepare creation request
$customer = (new Customer())
    ->setFirstName('Steve')
    ->setLastName('Lastnameson')
    ->setEmail(uniqid('steve-').'@example.com')
    ->setTags(['foo', 'bar'])
    ->setVerifiedEmail(true)
    ->setAcceptsMarketing(true);
$request = Factory::make(CreateNewCustomerRequest::class)
    ->withCredentials($credentials)
    ->withCustomer($customer);

// Create new customer, $newCustomer is a Customer model
$service = Factory::make(CustomerService::class);
$newCustomer = $service->createNewCustomer($request);
var_dump($newCustomer);
```

### Get all customers created in the past 7 days

```php
use Yaspa\AdminApi\Customer\Builders\GetCustomersRequest;
use Yaspa\AdminApi\Customer\CustomerService;
use Yaspa\Factory;

// Create request
$request = Factory::make(GetCustomersRequest::class)
    ->withCredentials($credentials)
    ->withCreatedAtMin(new DateTime('-7 days'));

// Get customers, $customers is an iterator
$service = Factory::make(CustomerService::class);
$customers = $service->getCustomers($request);

// Loop through customers, each $customer is a Customer model
// paging is automated
foreach ($customers as $index => $customer) {
    var_dump($customer);
}
```

### Update a customer

```php
use Yaspa\AdminApi\Customer\Builders\ModifyExistingCustomerRequest;
use Yaspa\AdminApi\Customer\CustomerService;
use Yaspa\Factory;

// Create request
$customerUpdates = (new Customer())
    ->setId(6820000675)
    ->setFirstName('Alice')
$request = Factory::make(ModifyExistingCustomerRequest::class)
    ->withCredentials($credentials)
    ->withCustomer($customerUpdates);

// Modify an existing customer, $modifiedCustomer is a Customer model
$service = Factory::make(CustomerService::class);
$modifiedCustomer = $service->modifyExistingCustomer($request);
var_dump($modifiedCustomer);
```

### Delete a customer

```php
use Yaspa\AdminApi\Customer\CustomerService;
use Yaspa\Factory;

// Delete an existing customer
$service = Factory::make(CustomerService::class);
$service->deleteCustomer($credentials, 6820000675);
```
